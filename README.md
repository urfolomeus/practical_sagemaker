# Practical SageMaker Course

This repo contains the notebooks and such that were created as part of the [Practical SageMaker course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103tWG3@Vted68CU6gFQd2Jn4pJyAEe6px0LU-i0aZLElOZHTX6CZkvh1d2DcRTcJSaUhWbD/) on Udemy. I was using [SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/) to do this work.
